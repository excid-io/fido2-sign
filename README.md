# fido2-sign
## About 
FIDO2 can be used for signing arbitrary text. This is achieved by using the
digest of this text as the authenticator "challenge". For more information
about this procedure read the corresponding [article by Yubico](https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/Concepts/Using_WebAuthn_for_Signing.html)

## Demo
Visit the [project page](https://excid-io.github.io/fido2-sign/) of this repository.
Execute the steps one by one. At the final step you can edit the text to be verified
and check that the signature verification fails.
